# Marionette

Marionette is designed to train neural networks to play NES game, in a fashion akin to a marionette. The name is also a play on the words "Mario" and "Net", referencing the first supported NES game. Eventually, I hope to train neural networks on the raw visual data, instead of the contents of the NES's RAM.

Marionette uses the NEAT algorithm detailed in Kenneth Stanley's paper, "[Evolving Neural Networks through
Augmenting Topologies](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf)".

Supported Games:
- Super Mario Bros. (1987)
